# MediBot - Medicine Information Chatbot

## Overview
MediBot is a chatbot built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to provide quick, accurate, and easy-to-understand information about commonly used medications. It answers user queries related to the usage, side effects, and dosage of medications. The chatbot uses the `nltk` library for NLP, `scikit-learn` for machine learning, and `streamlit` for creating an interactive web interface.
